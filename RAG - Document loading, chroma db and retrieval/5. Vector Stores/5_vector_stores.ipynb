    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "One of the most common ways to store and search over unstructured data is to embed it and store the resulting embedding vectors, and then at query time to embed the unstructured query and retrieve the embedding vectors that are 'most similar' to the embedded query. A vector store takes care of storing embedded data and performing vector search for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/langchain_rag.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This walkthrough showcases basic functionality related to vector stores. A key part of working with vector stores is creating the vector to put in them, which is usually created via embeddings. Therefore, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the text embedding model interfaces before diving into this.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many great vector store options, here are a few that are free, open-source, and run entirely on your local machine. Review all integrations for many great hosted offerings.\n",

    "- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)\n",
    "\n",
    "This walkthrough uses the `chroma` vector database, which runs on your local machine as a library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Vector Store Key Attributes**\n",
    "- Can store large d-dimensional vectors\n",
    "- Can directly index an embedded vector to its associated string text document.\n",
    "- Can be \"Queried\", allowing for a cosine similarity search betwen new vector and the stored vectors.\n",
    "- Can easily add, update, or delete new vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Steps**\n",
    "1. Load a Document\n",
    "2. Split it into Chunks\n",
    "3. Generate vectors for each Chunk i.e. numerical embeddings\n",
    "4. Store the vectors in a Vector Store\n",
    "5. Apply similarity search, etc..."
